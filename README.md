### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**CamKirk/CamKirk** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

```js
function helloInJavaScript(){
    console.log("hello")
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("hello")
```

```python
import pandas as pd
df  = pd.DataFrame({})
df.head()
```
